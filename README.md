## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- React.js
- SCSS
- JSX
- Flexbox
- Regex for form validation
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project taught me how to use stateful components and pass props up from children. I also learned about conditional rendering! With some logic I was able to display a form or a success message based on the form inputs and whether the submit button was clicked.

### Continued development

I want to improve my skills in building applications that utilize RESTful API's and JSON/XML data. In my next project I'm going to build an [expenses chart](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt) in which the UI is generated from JSON data.

### Useful resources

- [React Form Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYpdEYK25Dc) - This video helped me a lot with the form validation aspect of the project.
